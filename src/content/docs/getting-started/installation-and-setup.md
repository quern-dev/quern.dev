## Prerequisites

You need two things before installing:

- **Xcode** — Full Xcode from the App Store, not just the Command Line Tools. You need it for simulators, `xcodebuild` (app and WDA builds), signing, and provisioning. Sign in to your Apple Developer account in Xcode > Settings > Accounts to manage signing identities.
- **Homebrew** — [brew.sh](https://brew.sh). Quern uses Homebrew to install most of its dependencies (idb, mitmproxy, libimobiledevice, etc.). Setup will not install Homebrew itself — if it's missing, you'll be told.
- **Android Studio** (optional) — Only needed if you're working with Android. Provides `adb`, `emulator`, and the SDK tools. Quern auto-discovers these from your PATH or the standard SDK install locations.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://quern.dev/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The installer downloads the latest release to `~/.local/share/quern`, then runs `quern setup`, which does everything else:

1. **Installs Python** (via Homebrew) if you don't already have Python 3.11+, then creates a virtual environment and installs server dependencies
2. **Checks for system tools** and offers to install what's missing:
   - **Xcode Command Line Tools** — for `simctl` (simulator control) and `devicectl` (iOS 17+ devices)
   - **idb + idb-companion** — for simulator UI automation (accessibility tree, tapping, typing)
   - **pymobiledevice3** — for physical device screenshots, logs, and tunneling
   - **mitmproxy** — for network traffic interception
   - **Node.js** — for the MCP wrapper
3. **Builds the MCP server** (TypeScript → JavaScript)
4. **Registers the MCP server** with Claude Code (writes to `~/.claude.json`)
5. **Adds `quern` to your PATH** (via `~/.local/bin`)
6. **Tracks what it installed** in `~/.quern/installed-by-setup.json` so `quern uninstall` can cleanly remove only what it added

Setup prompts before installing anything — it won't surprise you with Homebrew packages you didn't agree to. If a tool is already installed, it skips it.

### Where you run it from

Two moments, two spellings, and it is worth knowing which you are in.

**During the first setup** there is nothing on your PATH yet, so you run it by
path — `./quern setup` if you are standing in the directory. Quern installs to
`~/.local/share/quern`, which is probably not where your terminal is, so if you
are elsewhere give the full path: `~/.local/share/quern/quern setup`.

**Afterwards, just type `quern`.** Setup puts it on your PATH, so it works from
any directory and you never need to know where Quern lives. The rest of these
guides are written that way.

If the very next command reports `command not found: quern`, the shell is
caching where commands live and has not noticed a new one. Run `rehash` (zsh)
or open a new terminal.

Quern's own messages follow the same rule — when something goes wrong it names
the command the way *you* can type it, so if it prints a full path, that is
because the short name would not have worked from where you are.

When everything's ready, you'll see a summary like this:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Quern Setup Summary
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ✓ Platform: macOS 26.3.1
  ✓ Homebrew: Homebrew 5.0.16
  ✓ Python: 3.12.12

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  All checks passed — ready to go!
```

Not everything needs to be green. If you're only working with simulators, you won't have tunneld or libimobiledevice — that's fine. Setup tells you what's missing and what it affects.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (for contributors / development)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quern-dev/quern.git
cd quern
./quern setup
./quern mcp-install
```

`./quern` because you are in the clone. After setup `quern` also works from
anywhere — though in a clone, prefer `./quern`: with more than one checkout the
bare name resolves to whichever one setup last pointed it at.

</details>

### For Physical iOS Devices (iOS 17+)

Setup automatically installs the **tunneld** LaunchDaemon (it will ask for your sudo password). This creates persistent tunnels to connected iOS 17+ devices — required for screenshots, logs, and WDA on modern iPhones. See [Device Pool](/getting-started/device-pool/) for why this exists.

### For Android

Install Android Studio (or the standalone SDK tools). Quern finds `adb` and `emulator` automatically from your PATH, `ANDROID_HOME`, or the standard SDK install locations. No additional Quern setup needed.

## Start the Server

```bash
quern start              # Runs in the background
quern start -f           # Foreground mode (useful for troubleshooting the server itself)
```

On startup, Quern finds available ports, checks which tools are installed, and starts its log/proxy/crash adapters. It writes everything to `~/.quern/state.json`, which is how the MCP wrapper and CLI discover the server.

## Verify It Works

After starting, run `quern status` to confirm it's up and see which tools were detected. Then in your AI agent, try:

> "List my available devices"

or

> "Take a screenshot of the simulator and show me in Preview"

If you see devices and get a screenshot, you're good to go.

## Using Quern with Your AI Agent

### Claude Code

If you ran the installer, the MCP server is already registered. Just open Claude Code in your project and start asking:

> "Boot an iPhone 16 simulator, install my app, and show me what API calls happen during login"

If you installed manually, run `quern mcp-install` to register.

### Other MCP Clients

Point your client at: `node ~/.local/share/quern/mcp/dist/launcher.cjs`

Use `launcher.cjs` rather than `index.js`. It checks the Node version first and tells you which binary it is running under if that version is too old — worth having, because MCP clients do not always pick the node you expect.

Which `node` a client gets depends on how the client was started. A client opened from the Dock doesn't read your shell's startup files, so a Node installed with fnm, nvm, mise or asdf is invisible to it even when every terminal finds it. `quern doctor` shows the `node` found in each place: this terminal, a login shell, a non-interactive shell, apps opened from the Dock, and the Quern app itself. For any place where it's missing or older than 22, it gives the fix for that place.

For a client opened from the Dock, Homebrew does not help: launchd's PATH is `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, which `/opt/homebrew/bin` is not in. Set the client's `command` to an absolute path to a Node 22+ binary, or add a directory to every GUI app's PATH with `sudo launchctl config user path …` and log back in.

The MCP wrapper auto-discovers the running server via `~/.quern/state.json` — no URL or API key configuration needed.

## Server Lifecycle

```bash
quern status             # Is it running? What port? What tools are available?
quern stop               # Graceful shutdown
quern restart            # Stop + start
quern update             # Pull latest changes, reinstall deps, rebuild
quern uninstall          # Remove Quern and everything setup installed
```

The server runs as a background daemon. It survives terminal closure and persists until you explicitly stop it or reboot. If Quern's source code is updated (via `quern update` or `git pull`), restart the server to pick up changes.

## Configuration

Optional config at `~/.quern/config.json`:

```json
{
  "default_device_family": "iPhone",
  "local_capture": ["MobileSafari", "com.apple.WebKit.Networking"]
}
```

- **default_device_family**: When your agent asks for a device without specifying what kind, default to this. Usually "iPhone".
- **local_capture**: Process names for transparent network capture. Safari and WebKit are a good default — your agent can add your app's process name when it starts a debugging session. It is the whole list, not a set of additions: a process not named here is not captured.

## Where Things Live
