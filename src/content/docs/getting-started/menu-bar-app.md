title: "The Menu Bar App"
---


Quern runs as a background daemon, which means the honest answer to "is it
running?" usually involves a terminal. The Quern app puts that answer in your
menu bar instead, and gives you the handful of controls you would otherwise
type.

It calls itself **Quern app** in its own Settings, to tell it apart from the
**server** it reports on; those two carry separate versions, and on a git
install they can differ.

It is macOS only. Everything it does, the CLI already did.

## Getting it

If you installed Quern the normal way, it arrives with it. `quern setup`
installs the app and `quern update` keeps it current, so there is nothing
separate to download.

If you installed before v0.15.0 and have never updated, you will not have it —
the app ships inside the release asset rather than GitHub's generated source
tarball. One `quern update` brings it in.

### From a git clone

A clone does not get the app, and this is deliberate: `quern setup` skips it
on the assumption that anyone working from source would rather control their
own build than have one installed over it.

To install the signed app from the release your clone is based on:

```sh
quern menubar install
```

`quern update` doesn't replace the app on a clone either, so run the same
command after updating when `quern menubar status` (or `quern doctor`, or
`quern setup`) says the app is older than Quern. It leaves an app of the
current version alone, so it won't overwrite your own build of the same
version; add `--force` to reinstall anyway.

If you're working on the app itself, build it from your checkout instead:

```sh
scripts/install-menubar-app.sh --build
```

Both install to `~/Applications/Quern.app` and launch the app. A copy running
from *that* location is quit first so the new build actually starts; a Quern
running from somewhere else is left alone and reported, since quitting it is
not this command's business. The app starts the server itself, so that one command is the whole
setup — from there you can drive Quern from the menu bar and leave the CLI
alone.

One prerequisite, which both check for you: `quern setup` must have run
at least once, because that is what writes `~/.local/bin/quern`. The app drives
the daemon through that wrapper. A GUI app does not inherit your shell's PATH,
so a `quern` that works in your terminal is not enough — it looks for that
exact file. If it is missing, they say so and tell you what to run.

Take the default unless you are working on the app itself. A local build is
unsigned, so its code-signing identity changes every time you rebuild, macOS
treats each build as a different app, and launch-at-login and any permissions
you grant will not persist. The released build is signed and notarized, so
they do.

Either way the app only reads `~/.quern/*.json`, so it reports on whichever
server is running regardless of which install started it, and it will not start
a second one on top of a server that is already up.

It is installed to `~/Applications/Quern.app`, so Spotlight and Launchpad both
find it. If you quit it and want it back:

```sh
quern menubar open
```

`quern menubar status` shows which version is installed and whether it's
running. The menu shows the app's own version above **Settings…**, and Settings
shows it in its own **Quern app** section. The **Version** under **Server** is
the server's, which can differ on a git install.

`quern setup` starts the app if it isn't running. It only quits and restarts a
running copy when it's installing a new version.

## What the menu shows

Clicking the icon gives you the daemon's state at a glance:

```
Quern is running · up 3h
Active device: iPhone 16 Pro (Simulator)
Proxy: running :9101
```

The active device row names the device rather than showing its 36-character
identifier, and says what kind it is — `(Simulator)`, `(Device)` or
`(Emulator)` — because a simulator and the phone on your desk otherwise look
identical. When Quern has not enumerated the device it says nothing rather than
guessing, so an unqualified name means "type unknown", not "simulator".

The icon itself dims when the server is stopped, and its tooltip tells you when
an update is waiting.

## What you can do from it

**Start, stop and restart the server.** The same operations as `quern start`,
`quern stop` and `quern restart`. There is no separate lifecycle: the app does
not own the daemon, it asks.

**Restart to update.** Appears only once an update has been staged, and
restarts into the new version. This is the Ollama pattern — no separate
updater, no second update path. On a git install the item is **Update in
Terminal…** instead — see [Updating](#updating).

**Troubleshoot in Terminal.** Appears when the server didn't start, next to
**Open Server Log**. It opens a Terminal window that runs `quern doctor --fix`,
which repairs what it can, then `quern start`. The window stays open
afterwards, so you can read what happened and carry on from there. If the
`quern` command can't be found at all, the item is **Set Up in Terminal…**.

**Finish Update in Terminal.** Appears when an update stopped partway, and
runs `quern setup` then `quern restart`. It is a separate item, with its own
name, because it is shown whether or not the server is running — an update can
fail with the daemon still up, and a way out drawn only when the daemon is
down would be missing in that case. It stays until the server comes back on a
different version, so finishing the update by any route retires it, including
running `quern update` in your own terminal.

Every start or update failure that has a way out offers the same step as a
**Fix in Terminal** button on its alert.

Nothing opens Terminal by itself; it always takes a click. A failed start at
login only shows in the menu, but if the server fails to start within a few
minutes of an update, you get an alert, because you're probably watching.

**Check for Updates.** Shown instead, when nothing is staged. The hint the
item above depends on comes from a cache the server refreshes at most once a
day, so a release landing this afternoon would not be offered until tomorrow
and there was no way to ask. This asks now. A check that finds nothing says
so, because a menu identical before and after is indistinguishable from a
dead item.

**Screen mirror.** Opens a live view of connected devices. Windows fit the
device's own proportions, open when you plug a phone in, and close when you
unplug it. See [Live Video Preview](/ios/ios-preview/) for the detail.

This item is hidden if the screen-mirror app could not be built, which happens
when Xcode Command Line Tools are missing. `quern setup` will tell you, and
offer to open the installer.

**Settings.** Things you would otherwise reach for the CLI to change.

*Network capture* carries "Install the capture certificate automatically". Off
by default: capturing HTTPS needs each device to trust Quern's certificate
authority, and installing one is a bigger commitment than turning capture on,
so Quern asks the first time. Turn this on to answer once instead. The same
setting is `quern set-auto-install-cert`, and it is shown here so a standing
policy is visible and reversible rather than buried in a config file.

*Updates* carries "Check for updates automatically" and the channel picker,
stable or beta — the same settings as `quern set-update-check` and
`quern set-channel`.

The checkbox governs the *automatic* check alone. **Check for Updates** and
`quern check-updates` keep working when it is off, the way every updater
leaves Check Now working when the box is unticked. Turning it off says "do
not call home unprompted"; asking is a prompt.

There are also two launch toggles, and a read-only view of the server's
address, version and uptime, plus the full UDID of the active device — which
the menu deliberately leaves out to keep itself narrow.

*Launch at login* starts the Quern app when you log in. *Start the server
when Quern launches* is on by default: opening the Quern app and being told the
server is stopped, with a button to press, is a step that did not need to
exist. If the server is already running the app leaves it alone.

Those two together mean the daemon runs from login onward, which is why the
second one can be turned off. Starting the server opens its HTTP listener and
watches for crash reports. It does not begin capturing device or system logs,
and it does not touch the proxy or install any certificate — those stay behind
their own prompts.

Quitting the Quern app does not stop the server. Hold ⌥ over Quit when you
want both.

## Updating

How the app updates Quern depends on how Quern was installed. Settings shows
which you have, on the **Install** row.

**Release install** (the `curl … | bash` installer, in `~/.local/share/quern`):
**Restart to Update** does everything from the menu. The release ships its MCP
wrapper already built, so updating needs nothing from your shell.

**Git install** (a clone you ran `./quern setup` in): the item is **Update in
Terminal…**, which opens a Terminal window running `quern update`. A git
update rebuilds the MCP wrapper with npm, and the Quern app can't do that
reliably:

- Apps started from the Dock or at login don't read your shell's startup files,
  so a Node installed with fnm, nvm, Volta, asdf or mise isn't there for them.
  `quern doctor` shows which `node` each place finds.
- `git pull` may need to ask for credentials, and an app in the menu bar has nowhere to
  show that prompt.

Terminal has your environment, so the update runs there.

A git install also doesn't receive new versions of the Quern app from
`quern update`. To install the current one, run `quern menubar install`. Setup
and `quern doctor` say when the app is behind.

### Switching from a git install to a release install

If you don't work on Quern itself, a release install is simpler: updates run
from the menu, and the Quern app is updated along with everything else.

```bash
quern stop
curl -fsSL https://quern.dev/install.sh | bash
```

The installer puts Quern in `~/.local/share/quern` and runs setup from there.
Setup re-points the `quern` command at the new install, re-registers your MCP
clients, and installs the matching Quern app. Open a new terminal (or run
`rehash`) so your shell picks up the change, then check that Settings now says
**Release**.

Your settings, API key and device state live in `~/.quern` and are kept. The
clone is left where it was. Delete it if you don't need it.

To go back to the clone, run `./quern setup` inside it. That points `quern` and
your MCP clients at the clone again.

## Quitting

**Quit Quern** closes the app and leaves the server running. That is usually
what you want: the daemon is doing the work, and the menu bar is only a window
onto it.

Hold Option to reveal **Quit and Stop Server** for when you mean both. If the
stop fails, the app stays open and tells you, rather than quitting and leaving
a server running with nothing to say so.

## Launch at login

The app registers itself the first time it runs, so it comes back after a
reboot. Turn it off in Settings.

This depends on the app having a stable code-signing identity, which the
released build has. If you build the app yourself from `macos/QuernMenuBar`,
the signature changes on every rebuild and macOS will treat each one as a
different app, so launch-at-login and permissions will not stick. That is
expected for local development.

## What it deliberately does not do

It is not a control surface for Quern's features. There is no proxy toggle, no
device picker, no log viewer. Those live in the CLI and the MCP tools, where an
agent can reach them and where the output is something you can pipe.

The menu bar answers "is it up, what is it pointed at, and can I restart it" —
the questions you would otherwise open a terminal to answer.
